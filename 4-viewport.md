# CSS Units: vh, vw, vmin, vmax

Using `vh`, `vw`, `vmin`, or `vmax` to define font-size can be useful for scenarios where you want titles to scale with the viewport.

`vw` can be nice for when a user has a smaller screen. Your elements will adjust to the width.

`vmin` will pick the smaller of either `vh` or `vw`, and `vmax` will pick the bigger of those two.
