All exercises from [Conquering Responsive Layouts](https://courses.kevinpowell.co/conquering-responsive-layouts) by Kevn Powell.

## Progress

- Day 1: Learned how default style is already responsive, although not the most pleasant looking. We are the ones who make things unresponsive.
- Day 2: Undestood how `em`'s compounding effect can be powerful, but can also get out of hand. `rem` is a relative unit that eliminates the compounding effect meanwhile still allowing you to create scalable and predictable font sizes.
